The files in here will let you know the different things you can find under the `qmk` module when
running Python code on your QMK board.

However, they can't be imported nor run... You can think of them as a `.h` file telling you the
available functions on a C library.

NOTE: Intended location where to consume this documentation is [my website](<https://qmk.elpekenin.dev/modules/micropython.html>)
